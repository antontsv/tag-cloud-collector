# Tag Cloud Collector

Simple command line tool to collect rating/interest for abstract topics. 

Examples for the topics would be: 
* rank movies
* todo list priorities
* food choices

Collected information is written to Elastic Search and can be later on visualised in Kibana as a tag cloud, or a table.
